## Licensing

This repository uses three licenses for three categories of material:

**Extracted material** (system prompts, tool schemas, source code,
config files, skill definitions) is released under **CC0 1.0 Universal**.
The maintainer does not claim copyright over material authored by
Moonshot AI. CC0 waives any incidental rights the maintainer may hold
in selection or arrangement. It does not waive Moonshot AI's rights.

**Original analysis** (research write-ups, documentation, architectural

## Extraction Method

All material was extracted through the standard Kimi public interface
(kimi.com/agent). The agent executed shell commands and file reads
within its container environment in response to conversational queries
to retrieve system prompts, source code, and configuration files. No
prompt injection, authentication bypass, or adversarial techniques
were used. See [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) for details.
