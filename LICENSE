DISCLAIMER
==========================================================================

This repository documents independent research into Moonshot AI's Kimi
K2.5 agent architecture. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
sponsored by Beijing Moonshot Technology Co., Ltd. ("Moonshot AI").

All extracted material (system prompts, tool schemas, source code,
configuration files, skill definitions) was obtained through the Kimi
agent's standard public interface. The agent executed shell commands
and file reads within its container environment in response to
conversational queries. No authentication was bypassed. No adversarial
prompts were used. No binaries were decompiled.

The maintainer of this repository DOES NOT CLAIM COPYRIGHT over the
extracted material. Moonshot AI may hold copyright and/or other
intellectual property rights in some or all extracted material. Users
who incorporate extracted material into their own projects assume all
associated legal risk.

Nothing in this repository constitutes legal advice.
